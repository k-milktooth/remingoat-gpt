## Motivation

It's no surprise that [TheRemingoat switch reviews](https://www.theremingoat.com/), coming in at thousands of words each, are the most detailed switch reviews available. However, this verbosity has one major downside: it becomes unwieldy to read any given review, not to mention multiple reviews for when you're comparing many switches.

The obvious alternative is not to read the reviews and simply browse the provided score sheets. This shortcut is more time-efficient but ultimately lacks nuance.

The scores simply reflect theRemingoat's preferences, which you won't be mirroring. In other words, without context, scores are meaningless.

RemingoatGPT seeks to mitigate the downsides of **both** long-winded reviews and reductionist score sheets. An AI-powered Q&A chatbot that lets you query detailed data as needed could be the perfect synthesis of detail and efficiency‚Äîsimply ask and read what's relevant to you.

We hope RemingoatGPT facilitates an easier and more successful switch discovery and research process!
